<h2>>B.S. Courses </h2>
<p>
The Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) is a 3-year undergraduate academic degree focused on science, technology, and research. It is offered in multiple disciplines, allowing students to specialize in a specific field of science. Common B.Sc. courses include Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology, Zoology, Botany, Computer Science, and Environmental Science. Each course combines theoretical knowledge with practical laboratory experience.

For example, B.Sc. in Physics covers mechanics, optics, thermodynamics, and quantum physics. B.Sc. in Chemistry includes organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. B.Sc. in Mathematics emphasizes algebra, calculus, statistics, and analytical reasoning. B.Sc. in Computer Science includes programming, data structures, networking, and database management.

Students opting for B.Sc. in Life Sciences like Botany, Zoology, Biotechnology, or Microbiology study living organisms and biological systems. Courses like B.Sc. in Environmental Science and B.Sc. in Agriculture focus on ecological sustainability and agricultural practices.

A B.Sc. degree opens up opportunities in research labs, education, software companies, government exams, and higher education like M.Sc., MCA, or MBA. It builds analytical, logical, and observational skills essential for scientific careers.
